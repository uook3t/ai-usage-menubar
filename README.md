> **个人定制版**：基于 AI Usage v0.2.1，增加 VPN / JustMySocks 用量、可配置双行菜单栏、查询 URL 和独立刷新间隔。默认启用 Codex、Claude、VPN。VPN 配置统一使用 UserDefaults；本分支关闭官方自动更新。详见 [定制说明](docs/customization.md)。下方保留原项目介绍，其中官方更新、默认登录启动和不跨启动缓存等描述以定制说明为准。

AI Usage shows Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Antigravity, GitHub Copilot, Devin,
and Grok limits and stays out of the way. No extra account, API key, local
server, telemetry, usage history, or background log scanning.

Open the DMG, drag **AI Usage** to Applications, and launch it. It appears in
the menu bar rather than the Dock. macOS 26 or newer is required.

## What you get

- Claude Code session, weekly, Sonnet, and Fable limits
- Codex session, weekly, Spark, and Spark weekly limits
- Cursor total, Auto, and API usage
- Antigravity Gemini and Claude pool limits
- GitHub Copilot credits, chat, and completions
- Devin daily and weekly quota
- Grok weekly quota
- Claude Code extra usage and Codex credits when available
- Remaining or used percentages, switchable directly in the panel
- Independent menu bar controls and metric choices for each provider
- Configurable 1, 5, 15, 30, or 60-minute refresh and one-click manual refresh
- Signed update checks at launch and daily, plus **Check for Updates…**
- A direct **Update** button in the panel when a new version is available
- Provider cards only for installed tools, with signed-out status kept visible
- Native light and dark appearances with Liquid Glass
- Launch at Login enabled by default and still user-controllable

## Build from source

You need:

- macOS 26 or newer
- Xcode 27 or newer

Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/burakgon/ai-usage-menubar.git
cd ai-usage-menubar
./scripts/install.sh
```

The script builds a local Release version, installs it to
`~/Applications/AI Usage.app`, and opens it. AI Usage appears in the menu bar,
not the Dock.

To run without the installer, open `AIUsage.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the
`AIUsage` scheme.

## How it works

AI Usage reuses credentials already created by supported tools, then requests
quota data directly from each provider's first-party endpoint.

- Credentials stay on your Mac.
- Tokens are never printed, logged, or sent anywhere else.
- Temporary failures keep the last successful values in memory and mark them
  stale.
- Nothing is cached across launches.

API-key-only Codex authentication can't read ChatGPT subscription usage.
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is intentionally ignored because setup tokens don't
include the profile scope required by Claude's usage endpoint.

The exact researched contracts are documented in
[docs/provider-contracts.md](docs/provider-contracts.md).

## Menu bar behavior

Every provider can be shown or hidden independently. Under each provider,
choose any metric it currently returns. A single metric shows only its value;
multiple metrics use tiny labels to stay compact. **Weekly** is selected for
Claude Code and Codex by default, and **Left** is the default number mode.

Raw percentages are shown exactly as reported by the provider. Only progress
bar drawing is clamped to `0...100`. Remaining usage is bounded to `0...100`
because a negative remaining percentage is not meaningful.

## Development

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project AIUsage.xcodeproj \
  -scheme AIUsage \
  -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

The app is SwiftUI and AppKit, with a small provider layer and an in-memory
store. Its only runtime package dependency is
[Sparkle](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle), used for signed
over-the-air updates.

## Upstream research

Provider contracts and parts of the system-boundary implementation were
adapted from [OpenUsage](https://github.com/robinebers/openusage), using stable
tag `v0.7.6` and provider updates through commit
`9d2bf09f10e21f769494a525a9d65c84d7aeb1df`.
